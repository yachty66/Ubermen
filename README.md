- # Start

  - first nap is 16.05.2022 8pm

- # Preperation

  - ## Why do you want it?
    - Time win
    - Follow activities which I stopped following which brought me out of equilibrium (meeting people, exploring things)
    - become a more interesting person
    - counterintuitive (different from what is seen form society as normal)
    - mental exerise
    - productivity boost
    - life intensity
    - exploring
  - ## Do you have a reason other than wanting to try it out?
    - Goal is definetely to integrate this as an longterm solution
    - Can I adapt this a life long?
    - I get so much more from life if I do not die significant earlier or my mental state gets negative
    - Even if it is not working I can try everymen which is still a huge time win compared to normal 7 hours and if I did go through the hell with Ubermen it will be easier to adapt everymen.
